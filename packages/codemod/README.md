# Codemod

This script is used to modify files which use ICDS components to upgrade from v2 to v3 of the ICDS library.

## What is this used for

This codemod has been developed to help users migrate from v2 of ICDS components to v3. 

Given a directory, it will scan over files and find any relevant ICDS components that require a change either by component name or props used.

## How to run


This package will be usable as an executable, requiring a directory and optional test boolean argument to cover tests 

```console
- npx @ukic/codemod <dir> <test>
```

### Options:

```console
  --dir     Directory your project is located in using ICDS components
    [string]
```
```console
  --test   By default testing is false (with exception of types)
    [boolean]: true | false                                            
```

### Examples:
With tests
```console
- npx @ukic/codemod --dir ./#path/app/src/components --test true
```
Without tests
```console
- npx @ukic/codemod --dir ./#path/app/src/components
```
